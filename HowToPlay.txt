How To Play:
Congratulations! You are now a happy owner of your very own dog, and with great power, comes great responsibility so
you're gonna need to learn how to take care of your very own canine friend!

In a single day, you are allowed 3 actions. Use up these actions wisely to keep your dog happy and fit.

Needs:
Your dog has needs which needs to be maintained. The following needs are: Health, Exercise, Social and Hunger.

Health:
Health can be maintained by taking your pet to the vet for the hefty sum of £5. Once your dog is taken to the vet, your
dog will be as healthy as it can be with it's health fully maxed out! However, if your dog's health reaches 0, your dog
will die!

Exercise:
Your dog needs exercise. To increase the exercise of your dog, just take your canine friend for a walk. Be weary: if
your dog's exercise is 0, their health might take a hit the next day!

Social:
Your dogs are social creatures so they need your interaction to be happy. If your dog's social is 0, there may be a
chance that the RSPCA may take your dog away for neglect! (However, if you have enough money, you can bribe the RSPCA to
 leave you alone for a hefty sum of £20 which will automatically be taken from your account...)

Hunger:
Your dog needs to be fed on a daily basis. However, dog food costs £1. If your dog's hunger gets too low, their health
might take a hit so be weary to keep their health maintained!

Go to Work:
Taking your dog to the vet and keeping them fed costs money. To earn money, you can go to work!
