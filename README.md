## How to play

Congratulations! You are now the happy owner of your very own dog! With great power, comes great responsiblity, so you're gonna need to learn how to take care of your very own canine friend!

### Needs

Your dog has 4 needs which needs to be maintained:

|Need   |Description                                                     |
|:------|:-----------                                                    |
|Health   | Make sure this doesn't reach 0! Otherwise your dog will die...|
|Excercise| Your dog needs excercise. If excercise reaches 0, their health might take a hit the next day.
|Social| Your dogs are social creatures so they need your interaction to be happy. If your dog's social is 0, there may be a chance that the RSPCA may take your dog away for neglect! (However, if you have enough money, you can bribe the RSPCA to leave you alone for a hefty sum of £20 which will automatically be taken from your account...)
|Hunger| Your dog needs to be fed. If your dog's hunger gets too low, their health will take a hit so keep it maintained!

### Actions

Each day, you can choose to take up to 3 actions. The actions you can take are:

|Action|Description
|:----|:-----|
|Vet| Taking your pet to the vet will replenish your dog's health at the cost of £5.
|Walk| Walking your dog will increase its excercise.
|Play| Play with your dog to increase its social stat and stop them from being lonely.
|Feed| Increase your dog's hunger stat by feeding them at the cost of £1.
|Go to work| Go to work to earn more money to spend.
